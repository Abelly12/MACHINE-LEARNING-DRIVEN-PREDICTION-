# MACHINE-LEARNING-DRIVEN-PREDICTION
This project implements an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) integrated with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict CO₂ wettability in tight reservoirs. Unlike conventional machine learning models that often struggle with suboptimal hyperparameter tuning and overfitting, the PSO-XGBoost framework leverages the global optimization capability of PSO to automatically search and refine XGBoost hyperparameters. The enhanced PSO algorithm employs quick search clustering to maintain swarm diversity and avoid premature convergence, ensuring robust exploration of the solution space. By combining this optimization strategy with the predictive power of XGBoost, the model achieves:-Higher accuracy in predicting contact angles (wettability). Improved generalization across heterogeneous geological datasets. Efficient computation, outperforming other models such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, MLP, and SVR. Interpretability through SHAP analysis, identifying key factors (pressure, mineral composition, salinity) that influence wettability. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable, interpretable, and high-performance solution for optimizing CO₂ sequestration strategies in tight geological formations.
